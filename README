## Syntax
similar to QuickStatements V1
- LC = lexical category item ID
- LEM = lemma
- LANG = language QID
- LANG_CODE = wikimedia code for language e.g. "sv"
- Form syntax:
 - Rxx = representation language code e.g. "Rsv" for Swedish
 - GF = grammatical feature
 - FP = form property

see the examples-folder for more

## Setup
Copy config.example.py to config.py yourself and adjust the following
content:

username = "username"
password= "password"
