# LexBatchCreator
This script creates lexemes based on a special syntax that can be easily generated manually using LibreOffice or similar spreadsheet software or by other tools.

## Syntax
similar to QuickStatements V1
- LC = lexical category
- LEM = lemma
- LANG = language QID
- LANG_CODE = wikimedia code for language
- Form syntax:
 - Rxx = representation language code e.g. Rsv for Swedish
 - GF = grammatical feature
 - FP = form property

see test.tsv for an example

## Setup
Copy config.example.py to config.py yourself and adjust the following
content:

username = "username"
password= "password"
